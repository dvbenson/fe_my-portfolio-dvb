# Daniel VB Portfolio 
## **Tech:** Next.js, TailwindCSS, Turbo Pack
### _Vercel Hosting_

---

This project is an evolving piece of work, like many personal projects - the moment it was fully deployed, I had aleady redesigned it. This has since turned into a new plan and further projects.

I set out with the task to learn more about Next.js and took the opportunity to familiarise myself with the new App Directory in version 13. Opting for Turbo Pack as the app's compiler, alongside Vercel hosting, I'm using the Analytics tools to better understand web app performance optimisation.

The site is currently performing fantastically on mobile devices, but needs improvements on the FCP for desktop [29/4/2023]

## Upcoming Projects

- **Blog:** I'm going to be developing a personal blog
- **Design Showcase:** As a delve deeper into custom CSS and component prototyping, I'd like to showcase them on a dedicated page
- **Refactor/face-lift:** I have a new colour palette to bring across the board and I'd like to change the flow of the site to create a better UX and take advantage of Next's SSR/speed
